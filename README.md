A client-side modification for [Grok](https://grok.com), inspired by [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord). Patches Grok's bundled code at runtime with a plugin system, custom CSS editor, and theme support. No server-side changes, no telemetry. Works as a userscript or browser extension.

### Browser Extension

**Chrome / Chromium** — Build with `bun run build`, go to `chrome://extensions`, enable Developer Mode, click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist/chrome-unpacked` folder.

**Firefox** — Build with `bun run build`, go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`, click "Load Temporary Add-on" and select `dist/firefox-unpacked/manifest.json`.
